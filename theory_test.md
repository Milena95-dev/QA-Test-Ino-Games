## General Questions

### 1. What is the primary purpose of Quality Assurance (QA)?
The primary purpose of QA is to prevent errors, defects, and failures during the software development process, ensuring the product meets quality standards. This includes:
- Identifying and reporting issues early using tools like Jira or Monday.
- Prioritizing critical issues that may affect functionality or stability, such as system crashes.

### 2. What is the difference between a test case and a test plan?
- **Test Case**: A detailed description of a specific test scenario, including steps, current behavior, and expected results.
- **Test Plan**: A comprehensive document outlining the test strategy, objectives, scope, timeline, resources, and tools for testing.

### 3. What does the term 'regression testing' refer to?
Regression testing involves retesting all parts of the product, including changes, previous bugs, and test cases, to validate that recent changes do not affect existing functionalities.

### 4. How would you create a template to describe bugs in a software being constantly released?
A concise and standardized template:
- Bug ID
- Priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
- Device/browser used
- Test environment and build version
- Brief description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Attachments (screenshots/videos with audio)

### 5. What is the importance of test automation in QA? What would you explore for short-term game development?
Test automation:
- Reduces time for repetitive tasks.
- Ensures efficiency and reliability.
For games in short timeframes, I would explore:
- Basic functionality tests (loading, buttons, calculations).
- Stress tests.
- Security tests for player data protection.

### 6. Describe the main stages of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
1. **Requirements Analysis**
2. **Test Planning**
3. **Test Case Design**
4. **Test Environment Setup**
5. **Test Execution**
6. **Closure**

### 7. How would you handle a 'not reproducible' bug?
- Review test environments with the developer.
- Conduct pair testing.
- Reproduce under supervision.
- Improve the bug report for clarity.
